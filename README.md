*Deepfake Video Detection Using ResNet and LSTM Models*

What is Deepfake?
Deep fake is a technique for human image synthesis based on artificial intelligence.

Detecting deep fake videos is addressed using three different models: ResNet101, ResNet50, and ResNet152, each integrated with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers.

Dataset Description:
The dataset choosen is Celeb-DF-v2. This dataset contains total 1,518 real and fake videos

Results indicate that ResNet101 combined with LSTM achieved the highest accuracy of 91.78%, followed by ResNet152 with LSTM at 90.35%, and ResNet50 with LSTM at 90.23%. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of using deep neural networks enhanced with LSTM layers for deep fake detection, with ResNet101 showing the best performance.
